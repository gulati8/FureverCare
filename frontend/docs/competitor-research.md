## Recommendations for FureverCare

Based on this competitive analysis:

1. **AI Features are Table Stakes:** TranscribeAI (Shepherd) and Tails AI (Digitail) set expectations. Consider AI-assisted note-taking as a core feature.

2. **Pet Parent App is Differentiating:** Digitail and PetDesk show strong engagement through mobile apps. Self-service reduces staff burden.

3. **Visual Design:** Modern, clean, and professional. Blue/teal conveys trust. Green suggests health/growth. Avoid cluttered interfaces.

4. **Pricing Transparency:** Consider transparent pricing like Shepherd. Many competitors hide pricing, which can frustrate prospects.

5. **Niche Focus:** Instinct succeeded by focusing on ER/specialty. Consider specific veterinary niches for positioning.

6. **Integration Ecosystem:** Lab integrations (IDEXX, Zoetis) are expected. Payment processing and accounting integrations add value.

7. **Support Quality:** Instinct's 24/7 human support is a major differentiator. Response time matters.
