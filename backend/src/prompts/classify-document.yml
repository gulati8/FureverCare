  Evaluate the document and provide:
  1. The most likely document type
  2. A confidence score from 0-100
  3. A brief explanation of why you classified it this way
  4. Any alternative types it could be (if confidence < 80)

  Respond with a JSON object:
  {
    "document_type": "medication_label",
    "confidence": 85,
    "explanation": "Document shows a prescription label with drug name, dosage, and pharmacy information",
    "alternative_types": ["prescription"],
    "pet_name": "Max" // if visible
  }

  If confidence is below 50%, explain what makes the document difficult to classify.
  Only classify based on what you can actually see - do not guess.
